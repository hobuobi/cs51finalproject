FOR BEST RESULTS CHECK OUT DLalgorithms.py and tests.py and run tests.py!
Most of the other code in this folder is just stuff we wrote on our ascent to programming
masters. Take for it what you will but for the purposes of grading we'd like to direct
your attention to the 2 files mentioned above. Thanks and have a nice day! :)
